## Goal for the first milestone

1. Build an asynchronous & non-blocking REST application using the Play framework and reactive mongo plugin
2. Basic API that allows us to perform the basic CRUD operations for the data stored in a mongo database.

### About ReactiveMongo
[ReactiveMongo](http://reactivemongo.org/) is an asynchronous and non-blocking Scala driver for MongoDB. 
In addition to performing standard CRUD operations, it also supports querying the data as a stream, which helps to process a large amount of data with minimal overhead.

### Resources
- [Reactive Scala Driver for MongoDB for Play](http://reactivemongo.org/releases/1.0/documentation/tutorial/play.html)
- [testcontainers-scala for MongoDb](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-scala)
- [Play framework](https://www.playframework.com/)
- [Introduction to Reactive Mongo](https://www.baeldung.com/scala/mongo-reactive-intro)

### Online example projects

- [Full stack ScalaBlog, but old](https://github.com/kairos34/ScalaBlog)
- [scala-play-blog with Web socket example](https://github.com/mykisscool/scala-play-blog)
- [play-mongo based on this project](https://github.com/smahjoub/play-mongo)
- [Official reactivemongo-demo-app](https://github.com/ReactiveMongo/reactivemongo-demo-app)

### Technologies used
- Scala 2.13
- Sbt 1.13
- Play 2.8
- Docker images:
  - mongo
  - mongo-express
    
### Run the docker 
```
Run: docker-compose up
Mongo express: http://localhost:8081/

# Connect using mongo shell
docker ps
docker exec -it <ContainerID> bash
mongo mongodb://localhost:27017 -u rootuser -p rootpass

# list all the databases
show dbs;

# Create or switch to database
use blogs;

# Run below functions inside the blogs database
db.getName();
db.createCollection("Hello World!");

# Delete the database
db.dropDatabase();

db.help();

# Collections
db.createCollection("person");
show collections
db.person.stats();
db.person.drop();

# Collections with configuration
db.createCollection("person", {capped: true, size: 6142800, max: 3000});
db.person.stats()
```

### About the web project
- Build a simple initial point for the blog application
- Should have a CRUD operation for the project

## Know issues
1. Disable auto clean-up imports in Intellij for this project
  - Look for the release note for this version of [ReactiveMongo 0.20.13](http://reactivemongo.org/releases/0.1x/documentation/release-details.html)
  - Following imports should be in the model class
```
# Used for the JSON/BSON conversion
import reactivemongo.play.json._

# Used for the Joda DateTime to BSON type conversion 
import play.api.libs.json.JodaWrites._
import play.api.libs.json.JodaReads._
```
2. At the moment, if the docker container of MongoDb is initialized with the username and password, then the ReactiveMongo won't connect even using the required url.
Might need to look into more, see the document regarding [connection](http://reactivemongo.org/releases/1.0/documentation/tutorial/connect-database.html). 
   Hence, the environment variables for username and password are disabled in the docker-compose file.
